# Energized Lock Out Container (ELOC)

ELOC is an e-bike storage solution to increase your range, without increasing your weight. With e-bikes becoming increasingly popular as a greener and healthier commuting option, our solution allows for charging of any e-bike so commuters do not have to worry about insufficient charge for their subsequent trips. ELOC features a fully autonomous process to load, lock, and charge your e-bike. With only the addition of a lightweight wireless power transfer adapter, our custom wireless charging technology provides enough power to charge a typical e-bike battery to 80% while securely locked throughout the day.

ELOC is a Capstone Design project made by four Mechatronics Engineering students at the University of Waterloo.
